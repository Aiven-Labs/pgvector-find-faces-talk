> **Note** an early version of this talk was rehearsed at [CamPUG](https://www.meetup.com/campug) on [Tuesday

There are two directories here:

* [slides](./slides) contains the sources for the slides themselves, as well
  as a PDF of the slides.
* [src](./src) contains the Python programs I used when following the
  tutorial [Image recognition with Python, OpenCV, OpenAI CLIP and
  pgvector](https://aiven.io/developer/find-faces-with-pgvector), on which
  this talk is based.

See also the Aiven Labs repository
[pgvector-image-recognition](https://github.com/Aiven-Labs/pgvector-image-recognition)
for other materials relating to that tutorial.
