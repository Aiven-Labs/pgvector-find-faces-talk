A talk about using Python, OpenCV, OpenAI CLIP, PostgreSQL and pgvector to
find pictures containing a given face, and why that might be a good thing to do.

This talk is based upon and inspired by the tutorial [Image recognition with Python, OpenCV, OpenAI CLIP and pgvector](https://aiven.io/developer/find-faces-with-pgvector)

> **Note** an early version of this talk was rehearsed at [CamPUG](https://www.meetup.com/campug) on [Tuesday
 5th September 2023](https://www.meetup.com/campug/events/295523764/).

There are two directories here:

* [slides](./slides) contains the sources for the slides themselves, as well
  as a PDF of the slides.
* [src](./src) contains the Python programs I used when following the
  tutorial.

for other materials relating to the tutorial.
