Source and slides for the talk "How I used PostgreSQL® to find pictures of me
at a party", given by [Tibs](https://aiven.io/tibs):

1. At [PyCon UK 2023](https://2023.pyconuk.org/). The video is available [on
   YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FqKxKVJGWQ).

2. At [EuroPython 2024](https://ep2024.europython.eu/). The video will be
   linked when it is available.

A talk about using Python, OpenCV, OpenAI CLIP, PostgreSQL and pgvector to
find pictures containing a given face, and why that might be a good thing to do.

This talk is based upon and inspired by the tutorial [Image recognition with Python, OpenCV, OpenAI CLIP and pgvector](https://aiven.io/developer/find-faces-with-pgvector).
There's also [a GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Aiven-Labs/pgvector-image-recognition) with
[a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Aiven-Labs/pgvector-image-recognition/blob/main/main.ipynb)
showing working code for that tutorial.

> **Note** an early version of this talk was rehearsed at [CamPUG](https://www.meetup.com/campug) on [Tuesday
 5th September 2023](https://www.meetup.com/campug/events/295523764/).

There are two directories here:

* [slides](./slides) contains the sources for the slides themselves, as well
  as a PDF of the slides.
* [src](./src) contains the Python programs I used when following the
  tutorial.
