* `Colorful vectors`_ by JP Hwang (`@_jphwang`), an Educator at Weaviate_,
  which illustrates vector search in RGB space with interactive images
* `Vector Embeddings for Developers: The Basics`_ at Pinecone_ is a nice
  introduction to what vector embeddings are and why they're useful
* `Vector Embeddings Explained`_, again from Weaviate_, is a nice explanation,
  and gives the now classic example of how it allows the computation of::

    king − man + woman ≈ queen

* If you're after a bit more mathematics (and Python code), the Aiven tutorial
  also references Mathias Grønne's `Introduction to Image Embedding and
  Accuracy`_, which uses information about a book as its base. This article
  covers a lot more of the ideas of *embedding*, *similarity* and
  *clustering*.

  And quoting that article:

    The process of representing something in a computer is called embedding.

  So a "vector embedding" is a vector that represents something, or a
  representation of something as an array of numbers.

* In general, `What are embeddings`_ by `Vicki Boykis`_ looks like a very
  useful resource, and the `Next`_ section of that site seems to have lots of
  very interesting references - I especially like `The Illustrated Word2vec`_
  by Jay Alammar, but there's a lot more there that I want to read.

* The article `Face Detection with Haar Cascade`_ by Girija Shankar Behera
  describes how a Haar Cascade model recognises faces.

* `Sebi's demo`_ - my colleague Sébastien Blanc tweeting a video showing his
  cool demo of using ``pgvector`` to find nearest colours by RGB.

And the "`AI and ethics`_" talk from `Write the Docs Atlantic`_ when it's
available - this talk by `Chris Meyns`_ was called "AI ethics for tech writers", but really it
is an excellent talk about the ethics around AI regardless of why you're using it.
